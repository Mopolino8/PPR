The <b>PPR</b> pacakge is a Fortran library for high-order piecewise polynomial reconstruction and conservative integral re-mapping. Such operations can be used to construct high-order finite-volume and/or arbitrary lagrangian-eulerian type algorithms for the solution of hyperbolic transport problems.

The <b>PPR</b> package supports a variety of conservative polynomial reconstructions, including the piecewise constant, linear, parabolic and quartic types. Each interpolant can be combined with a selection of slope-limiters, including monotonicity-preserving and WENO-type approaches. Support is provided for both uniform and non-uniform structured discretisations.
